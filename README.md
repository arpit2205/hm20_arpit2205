# IDEA / ABOUT

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Society should aim to make women feel strong enough to fight the parasites of our society so that they can protect themselves against any sexual assaults. The society should aim at giving power to those without whom we cease to exist.

SOLUTION
Women should never feel alone while walking their way to work, home or a party. In case of some trouble or issue, she would feel secure if her family is always keeping an eye on her location.

My idea is to build a simple, minimalistic, and easy to use web application using which women can send their current location to any of their contacts via text with just a single click.

In case of an emergency, what all they have to do is : 1. Open the web application. 2. Give location access (automatically asked on the button click). 3. Click "Send Location" button. 4. Select a contact (or multiple) and send.

FEATURES / WORKING
On the homepage (and the only page) of my web application, there would be a greeting message and a button to allow location access. Once the user allows the location access, the user is automatically prompted by a message showing his/her current location in terms of latitude and longitude.

Below this button will be a button to send the location to a contact. Once it is clicked, it automatically redirects to the messaging application with a personalised message containing a request for help and a google maps link of the location of the user. Preview of the message : "This is an SOS Alert! The sender is in trouble, reach them - http://www.google.com/maps/place/{latitude},{longitude}".

Not only this, to make the user experience much more friendly, below the send location button, I'll be adding a few cliparts and information related to women safety and women emergency helpline numbers.

TOOLS / LANGUAGES
I'll be using HTML to create the structure of the web application, CSS to design and format the application, JavaScript to write the logic behind the working and Visual Studio Code as the code editor.

CONSTRAINT
Although I'll make this web application responsive but it will be meaningful only for mobile phones since this application tries to open the messaging app which is generally not installed in PC's or laptops. Also, since it is meant to be used in case of an emergency, a mobile phone would be the right choice.
